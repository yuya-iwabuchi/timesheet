Timesheet
---

This project is to make my timesheet-ing life easier at BlancLabs.  
You can use the app [here](https://yuya-iwabuchi.github.io/timesheet/).

Notes
---

This is a simple React app, too lazy to integrate Redux thus it's working by hacky and messy usage of React states.
GitHub Pages with serving `/docs` is used to host the web app.


Feel free to create issues for bug reports or suggests.  
Also feel free to create PR, but the code is currently written with no scalability and no maintainability in mind, so be wary.
